# Strimzi Kafka CLI

Strimzi Kafka CLI is a CLI that helps traditional Apache Kafka users -both developers and administrators- to easily adapt to [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io/),
a [Kubernetes operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/strimzi-kafka-operator) for [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).

The main intention is to ramp up Strimzi usage by creating a similar CLI experience with the traditional Apache Kafka tools that mostly starts with `kafka-*` prefix under the `bin` directory in an ordinary Kafka package.

Strimzi Kafka CLI uses the `kfk` command as an abbreviation for "**K**afka **F**or **K**ubernetes" or simply "**k** a **f** **k** a" which reminds of the `kafka-*` prefix of the ordinary Kafka script file names.

While having similar set of commands or options for some of the common objects, Strimzi Kafka CLI has some extra capabilities for managing or configuring Strimzi related resources.

Following are the commands of the current version of Strimzi Kafka CLI, that are used for different purposes:

``` bash
Usage: kfk [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Strimzi Kafka CLI

Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.

  env               Prints the environment variable values for Strimzi Kafka CLI
  operator          Installs/Uninstalls Strimzi Kafka Operator
  topics            Creates, alters, deletes, describes Kafka topic(s).

```

Please take a look at the relevant article [Strimzi Kafka CLI: Managing Strimzi in a Kafka Native Way](https://www.systemcraftsman.com/2020/08/25/strimzi-kafka-cli-managing-strimzi-in-a-kafka-native-way/) for more details.

## Installation

### Using Python Package Installer

``` bash
pip install strimzi-kafka-cli --user
```

Or to install Strimzi Kafka CLI in an isolated environment, you can simply use [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):

``` bash
pipx install strimzi-kafka-cli
```

### Using Homebrew

``` bash
#Tap the homebrew repository first.
brew tap systemcraftsman/strimzi-kafka-cli

#Install Strimzi Kafka CLI
brew install strimzi-kafka-cli
```

> Installing the CLI by using Homebrew already uses a virtual environment, so you don't have to worry about your main Python environment.

Project requires: Python >=3.8

## Dependencies
### Python Dependencies
Please see [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/SystemCraftsman/strimzi-kafka-cli/blob/main/pyproject.toml) file.
### External Dependencies
`kubectl` and `Strimzi resources` are the tools that Strimzi Kafka CLI uses. These dependencies are automatically downloaded when the first `kfk` command is run. You can always check the dependency versions of your CLI with the following command:

``` bash
kfk --version
```

If you want to change the `kubectl` and `Strimzi resources` folder, you can simply change their version with the help of some environment variables in order to let Strimzi Kafka CLI download the version you want, or change the PATH of any if you want to use a custom kubectl or Strimzi binary folder. Current versions are recommended, so use these environment variables at your own risk.

**STRIMZI_KAFKA_CLI_BASE_PATH:** Set this if you want to have a custom Strimzi Kafka CLI folder. It is `~/.strimzi-kafka-cli` as default.

**STRIMZI_KAFKA_CLI_STRIMZI_VERSION:** Set this if you want to use a different Strimzi version.

**STRIMZI_KAFKA_CLI_STRIMZI_PATH:** Set this if you want to use a custom Strimzi/AMQ Streams.

**STRIMZI_KAFKA_CLI_KUBECTL_VERSION** Set this if you want to use a different kubectl version.

**STRIMZI_KAFKA_CLI_KUBECTL_PATH:** Set this if you want to use a custom kubectl.
