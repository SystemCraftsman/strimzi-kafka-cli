# Strimzi Kafka CLI

Strimzi Kafka CLI is a CLI that helps traditional Apache Kafka users
-mostly administrators- to easily adapt [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io/),
a [Kubernetes
operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/strimzi-kafka-operator) for
[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).

Intention here is to ramp up Strimzi usage by creating a similar CLI
experience with traditional Apache Kafka binaries. For example:

| Native Command                             | Strimzi CLI Command  |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| $KAFKA\_HOME/bin/kafka-topics.sh           | kfk topics           |
| $KAFKA\_HOME/bin/kafka-configs.sh          | kfk configs          |
| $KAFKA\_HOME/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh | kfk console-consumer |

**kfk** command stands for the traditional **kafka-**\* prefix of the
Apache Kafka runnable files which are located in *bin* directory. There
are options provided like *topics*, *console-consumer*, etc. which also
mostly stand for the rest of the runnable file names like
*kafka-topic.sh*.

However, because of the nature of Strimzi and its capabilities, there
are also non-traditional options like *clusters* which is used for
cluster configuration or *users* which is used for user management and
configuration.

Following is the high-level output of the Strimzi Kafka CLI:

``` bash
Usage: kfk [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Strimzi Kafka CLI

  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  clusters          The kafka cluster(s) to be created, altered or...

  console-producer  The console producer is a tool that reads data from...
  topics            The kafka topic(s) to be created, altered or described.

```
